# 0.2.4 (Version Release ðŸ¥³)
The package is really stable (at least on the tested platforms).

### Platforms Tested:
- Windows 10
- Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow)
- Firefox
- Node.js CLI

I can't test the package in other platforms because I don't have other devices (I'm poor guys).

### Ionic Plans
I tried to make the an *@ionic-native* plugin, but my equipment is too old and is really hard to test in ionic because many errors and also require several compilation times. Errors aren't the problem, just my equipment takes a lot of time to re-compile every change, so, sorry.
